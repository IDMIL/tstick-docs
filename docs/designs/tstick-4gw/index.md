# General Information

## Introduction

The T-Stick 4GW was designed by Eduardo Meneses and Alex Nieva with the first revision being completed in 2018. This generation of T-Sticks is a Wi-Fi based system using Open Sound Control and later Libmapper for sending signals. It uses the ESP32 microcontroller for controlling the T-Stick. Multiple development boards such as the Lolin D32 and TinyPico have been used with this design. Although the design is modular and can in theory support T-Sticks up to the length of a Tenor T-Stick. Limitations due to how the T-Stick is constructed and firmware makes this design appropriate only for Sopranino and Soprano T-Sticks.
